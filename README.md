# flaskapi-azureconnection
 This script is a Flask web application that acts as a simple API for executing SQL queries on an Azure Synapse SQL database. It exposes a single API endpoint (/query) that accepts POST requests with a JSON payload containing a 'query' key, and it returns the results of the executed SQL query in JSON format. The application uses the pyodbc library to connect to the Azure Synapse SQL database and the pandas library to convert query results into a JSON-friendly format. It's a basic example and should be extended with security measures and additional features for a production environment.
